# FACIAL-EXPRESSION-RECOGNITION
Facial emotion recognition is a well-established field with broad applications in human-computer
interaction, affective computing, and social robotics. This project aims to improve the precision of
facial emotion recognition models by integrating Convolutional Neural Networks and
incorporating deep learning techniques. It also seeks to assess and compare the effectiveness of
different approaches within this context.
The project begins by examining the FER2013 dataset and data collection technologies,
highlighting the challenges associated with this dataset. It then provides a comprehensive analysis
of various facial expression recognition models, including the baseline model and various transfer
learning techniques. Experimental results, based on the FER2013 dataset, are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. VGG16 and MobileNet performed excellently with
accuracy scores of 68% and 70% respectively.
